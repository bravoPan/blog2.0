Summer vacation seems a bit longer, spending days and days at home, how to kill this time. Eating, learning, sleeping, again and again, it indeed likes one of the friends ever said, a little scared but endless. Roting the English words with the sunlight at dawn, eating bread as breakfast with milk, this is the coziest thing I experience the day. Staring the screen almost for the whole day makes my eyes dry as a bone, nothing different, nothing unique, does everyone experience this? As one is born, as one goes. Maybe the most exciting thing is the fitness every two days, sweating, holding the apparatus, the ache and tearing muscle are the evidence I am alive.\r\n\r\nSilent in appearance, but fresh in the mind, that might be the secret of every melancholiac, poet and also artist. The gap between reality and imagination fears you, that quite like you discover you are with nothing weaken from a dream. What should I do, who is the master of my life? What is the meaning of our lives, studying, working, reproducing, and die. One is born with unequal undoubtedly, \r\n\r\nSilent in appearance, but fire in the heart, that might be the secret of being a person. I always insist on myself and tell me I can do it, but it is endless, so long that I could not see the end, naturally, trapped in panic,  this kind of panic would let you fear everything, unwilling to do anything that you ever fight with.\r\nGradually, even though the most confident thing that you are adept would be mess up. Lacking confidence is a really bad because I will never step my feet toward the direction that I had yet planned. The lucky thing is I am never a weak man, even though something strikes dramatically, I will stand up again, never say give up, never settle, maybe that is why I differ from others. \r\n\r\nTime flies, something you could not imagine, people are always changing, I have been changed a lot after graduating from senior school, that is the most horrible period I experienced in the whole life. Listening classes, (some teachers in the senior school are real unqualified, especially the head-teacher, math teacher, watching her solving a problem consuming the whole class was one of the funny activities during that dark time, why she could spend the whole class time? She was lack of preparing the class,  I hate the person who said it is old enough to teach you something as a reason not devoting 100% efforts, next time write the detail, a long story), solving the problem sets, going to the after-class tutor center, for the one year, just doing these fucking things. Sleeping is the happiest thing I just want, that likes hemp, like the drug, easing my life. \r\n\r\nFine, yet writing so much, spending 1 hour, just escaping speaking practice, but feel good, at least better than thinking in the blank.

Father was preparing the burial ritual(calling some carpenters to make coffin for grandparents), since they have been grown such an age, death is no more remote and unfamiliar with them, preparing is not unrespect to them, at least people in the countryside always think highly of that, maybe people in the city are so poor that most of them have no choice but to cremate after they are dead. Luckily, everyone was not sad and even a pleasure revealed from their eyes. Noticing the location in front of the gate the big elm should be original, even it was removed for a long time 2 or 3 years, that big elm was old enough(bigger than me), when I was a little boy, it had been so tall in my memory. Facing the profile of my grandparents\u2019, I had no words and don\u2019t know what to say at that moment, we looked each other silently, leaving the carpenter cutting the wood, polishing the plank, spraying the saw dust flying in the air. Noisy from the machine spread through the whole house, but everything appeared in my mind clearly during the time when I lived with them including my childhood and the family history. \r\n\r\nIn my memory, my grandparents didn\u2019t get a good education, but he loves reading, especially \u201cthree kingdoms\u201d, reading them over and over again when he came to my house in the city., and he loves red face \u201cguan yu\u201d, right and brave, as most people, most of the stories I heard when I was young just from his words. Expecting his children succeeding in the learning, but unfortunately, none of his children get the university degree. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine children in the countryside couldn't get a good education and compete with students in the city until now, not to mention that material insufficient age. I admire my grandfather because I used to study at the countryside primary school, he usually hovered at he gate of the school, using his old bicycle with beam to pick me to home, no absence at once and even responsible than my mom when I study in the city. The regular thing also includes buying me unhealthy food(\u201csanwu\u201d, everyone also should know that, but people in countryside consider them are good things for children since there aren\u2019t anything better to purchase and if any they couldn\u2019t afford, anyway, which equals to express their love for children). Sitting backseat of the bicycle, holding food might be most satisfying things at that time(I recently knew I was sent to the countryside in order to avoid disease when sars burst out in China). The other thing I heard from my aunt was when he was working in the city, once he fell down from the scaffold, at the height of 3 or 4 storey, but he never told anyone without his workmates, reviving at the hospital solely for several months until he could move individually. I ever saw the precious photo which he took at the young age(20 ages), handsome(no kidding) absolutely, but he could never come back again since he lost one of his eyes when celebrating my old brother\u2019s full-month feast and had an operation several years ago. The story of his right eye should draw back to twenty-one years ago, the old as my brother, that day should be happy for him because of the birth of his first grandson, but when he was chopping wood, one sharp wood burst out from the rough stake into his right eye. He lied curly on the ground until someone found him and my father immediately sent him to the hospital. Luckily, it didn\u2019t endanger his life, but one of his eyes was lost forever, for 21 years on this summer vacation when my brother had his birthday. Everyone at home said him stubborn, remarking characters on the screen endlessly even though they are fake, and when he was after operation on his leg at the hospital, doctors said moving his leg slowly could be beneficial for his recovery, but he refused to move just because of distress it brought, and he didn\u2019t get on well with grandma usually, making her nearly cry every time, but the real reason(I guess) is he lost the leader position at home when he couldn\u2019t contribute to this family, all heavy workload shifted on my father\u2019s shoulder. One thing more is he admires Mao, one of his supporters and even said the life would be better if Mao was alive(I could feel the misleading of the Chinese medium vividly, happening around my life).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too long, beyond my expectation, deciding to divide the article into 2 parts.", "date": "2017-07-31", "description": "This two days, I went old house where my grandparents lived, having some thoughts about them and days I lived with them when I was young.", "type": "Life", "lock": true, "view_time": 27, "post_status": false, "image_url": ""}}, {"model": "blogapp.article", "pk": 667, "fields": {"title": "my grandparents II", "content": "Ah, a free time, continuing my writing of my grandparents. But actually, I think everyone in my family is characteristic and they have their unique story, everyone\u2019s experience is so different and realistic, but limited to time(maybe finish in the future, uncertain time) I couldn\u2019t write all of them down. So this time I am going to talk about my grandma, a kind-hearted woman, bringing up 3 kids and upholding family in the small village, she used to support the whole family by plowing the farmland when grandpa worked in the city, caring three kids and coping with unfriendly relatives(people in the countryside always quarrel for this trivial matters, fighting for profits even nominal, but unluckily my grandma was always on the weak side, all in all, all things had been gone with the wind, until now they don\u2019t want to put the past things on the desk), the days \r\n\r\nDeep in mind, my grandma is a kid-loving elder, especially when I and my brother were born. Her leg is not good, feeling distressed vastly in the rainy days(so did my mother\u2019s mother, maybe something relevant to the long-lasting labor in the farmland, an epidemic in the countryside), recent years got worse, beginning holding the walking stick when roaming. Once I viewed one of our(at that time I had not born yet\u2026) family photos, she seemed so young and vigorous, particularly her face, with little wrinkle, but I couldn\u2019t retrieve when her skin on the face collapse, maybe one of reason I get so surprised why she could become old rapidly is she always wearing the artificial tooth, providing the force to uphold the skin, and I seldom notice her face without artificial tooth. She is so sentimental, worrying this and worrying that, even the smallest thing so that my parents do not dare to tell her some bad news, for example, my father\u2019s business get bad or I went another province studying. Another anecdote is one of his brothers got lost when they escaped starvation and finally found him(after 2000 years). \r\n\r\nShe is so feudal, believe Buddinism even though they are not true, but you know religious always give people faith, this phenomenon happens more frequently in the countryside, worshiping ghosts and gods can\u2019t be common in the countryside and almost every family has some statues for worshiping. There are two things I could remember clearly about her feudalism, one is during the period when I prepare for my higher education entrance examination, she burned incense every day, according to what she said, the dust of incense could fill up the whole dustbin.(I am sorry to her that I didn\u2019t try my best study when I was in senior school) And the other one was when I was a little boy and I lived with them, once I accompanied with them farming on the field, then a rainbow appeared in the sky(that might be the most beautiful thing I viewed at the first time of life at that time) and I pointed that telling her \u201cLook, grandma, a rainbow\u201d. She suddenly blocked my finger and told me pointing the rainbow would cut off my finger(even now I still don\u2019t know how this stranger feudal ritual come from, maybe another black story tale). She kept burning incense when big days coming(celebrating the new year or the special day of every month\u2019s ), hoping everything goes smoothly and every member is in a good state. \r\n\r\nBut this time I went home, it seems that I have not too much to say, actually, the words become fewer begins when I come to the city, receiving education and having a comprehensive of the part of the real world has changed me, I am never a 5 years old boy limited that small place, the words naturally become distinct for her, I can\u2019t recome that day, doing homework on the cement plate in front of the gateway, digging the clay with me small hoe, acting as doctor injecting our persimmon tree with water by used needle tubing which leading it to produce abnormal fruit for many years. Growing gradually, having little to share. Everyone in my family says I am silent as a pole, but Why? People are all growing, some words you said at a young age you might think that is reasonable at that moment, but you will find that is amusing and foolish now, we all can\u2019t say that words just for amuse someone else for the whole life, keeping silent might be the right way. Little words could be a sign of the growth, a bridge that remarks I am old enough to do some normal things which an adult should do. Fine, come back to the right way, I couldn\u2019t figure out what she is thinking when we sitting together, she is fear? sad? or she is the pleasure with descent and the elaborate coffin? I just don\u2019t know, but the peace from her profile could be the answer, that\u2019s enough. Watching her profile should better than saying some words, and this time I feel the death vividly and realistically, for you know someday she will leave you, never come back, this is a cycle, the life cycle of every person. I even could imagine the day when I am going to pass away, what should say to my offsprings. At the time when we are going to leave, she nearly cried again, as usual, I don\u2019t know how many times left for me to see them for I am busier and busier as time goes even going abroad in the future. \r\n\r\nOk, all of my nonsense has been printed out, some thinking of mine and records of my grandparents\u2019 normal but nonpedestrian life.

strange title, isn\u2019t it, but actually it is an answer for the question which my father asked me on the way to the gym place. Sitting in the his car, he suddenly asked me:\u201d Hi pan, do you think your introverted personality has something to do with my eductional method when I treated you at your young age?.\u201d I perfunctorily said with low voice even he could not hear me, \u201cNo\u201d, I responded. In fact, I am abosolutely introverted, it depends on what\u2019s the defination of the \u201cintroverted\u201d. If he thinks non-introverted is when people communicate with others and never stop talking, I admit I am introverted. But why should we talk a lot with those nonsense which has no actual meaning, for maintain relationship? If I have no choice but to keep the relationship with others in this way, I even give up this friend. In another aspect, I am not conservational, for one thing, I know the importance of making friends and another one is  talking with different people is pretty interesting, everyone has their story, everyone is unique. Even I don\u2019t own this experience, it can expand my horizon. So the answer is clear, I am not introverted, what I talk and when I make firends are just exposed to him, I am just always like one that have been existed in his heart and never be changed. Maybe that just my real image for this man, something like he really doen\u2019t know me, there is a broad wall isolates ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very superised when he asked me such a question, I even think without hesitation and said to him, clearly, this is a irresponsible answer. But the answer is meaningless since I have been grown up and could not be reversed. I though this question all the time during my fitness in the gym and along the way home. And then, this article is just what I want to say. This man is so tired these day that spend his most time sleeping in the home, I don\u2019t know why he asked this question suddenly. But appearantly, his educational methdology has faults and even unsuccessful, because he never read educational books and adopt ways according to his own experience, in other words, his experience is from his parents(my grandparents), and to be exactly if based on the pedagogy, that is no eudcational methods. What he did most during my childhood is hitting me when I made mistakes, among which most situations are I didn\u2019t get expected grades. The goal of this Chinese traditional method is requesting children being submitted to parents, real Chinese. But one of which hurts me so much is my parents do not fulfill their promise when we made previously(such as I can give you reward if you can get xxx in xxx exam). One thing I remeber clearly is that in my junior school, I got a not bad grade and achieve his expectation and I requested a psp. But he just prefunctory said it was harmful for my study and forgot the promise at all. And I just believed his word \u201cIt would affect my grade\u201d, being timid to fight for my reasonable right. Buying it is one thing that he should have do and my grade is just another thing. So I am so desired of games during that young age, but you can\u2019t get it, just because timidness and their default, for six years. Staying in that comfort zone, numbing myself. I also have not a intimiate connection with my mom, I remebered clearly I always please her do not tell some important things to my father, or he will punish me. But in the evening when the family gets sleep, I could her their conversation, the voice penetrate my door and into my ears, the content is just my secret. At that time, I think why she betray me? And doesn\u2019t say yes when I request her? Gradually, I never trusted both of them anymore, not sharing my expreience in the school, not talking my mood, even with few word when we are sitting together. \r\n\r\nHowever, I\u2019m positive and embrace the future actively. Love making friends in the university, planning all the way, these just he doen\u2019t see. But the relationship between ours is hard to restore, this is a node, a dead node. All in all, I never complain about him, for I know he tries his best bringing us from that some village, that\u2019s enough. Be a man, a real man, change the life.", "date": "2017-08-15", "description": "an answer to my father's question.", "type": "Life", "lock": true, "view_time": 25, "post_status": false, "image_url": ""}}, {"model": "blogapp.article", "pk": 676, "fields": {"title": "recent_status", "content": "These two days, I really abandoned myself, I played computer games, downloaded games from GooglePlay, but little regret. This feeling is not the same as when I was in high school playing computer games hidden my parents, instead, maybe lack in stress, you have nothing to worry about. But I am really terribly upset, no clear reason, maybe stay at home too long, yes, university really changes me, it let me know I do not belong to anybody, I have my life, I could pursuit what I want. Drawing back when I was in high school, I was limited with my zone, even do not think higher of gaokao. It seems stupid at that time for someone else, but that was the real status at that time, even now I do not regret I got that grade and went to xjtlu. I think I was always confused when other students were striving for their university, but what I think was what I can do in the future. That was the first time I suspect my life, be a programmer? But in that way, why don\u2019t I study these things, I also told this idea to my brothers, and he replied what else can you do if you do not take gaokao? Do not thinkg useless thing all day, go to study. Plus at that period, I finished some exercise books but get very low grades even retreating at the first times tesets. That was what I finished during the whole summer vacation, a real hit for me, and I did not have good learning strategies at that time also, nobody to complain, every time is so similar, eat the same food cooked by my mom, same vegetables, same meat, same ingredient, even same word which was about my grade after one test. To be truth, I even have a little tendency to suicide at that time, but being alive is always better to going die. Even if everything in your life is what you dislike, abandoning yourself, being indifferent to others, is always common. Everyday, the first thing I dis when I first went home was surfing the Internet, watching funny videos, because I think in this way I can ease myself, even if the evening before the real examination, I was watching Youtube from 5 to 8 o\u2019clock, and I remember clearly just after the exam, my father drove home where we rented and moved original home inmediately, every action is so quickly, quickly to I can not wake. I had no feeling when I stayed at my room, watching everything would go away, not cherish the good time I spent here for three years, but something, but amazed at why he moved, he hates this community, this street, because he always quarreled with gate guard concerned with parking. \r\n\r\nEnvironment is pretty important, for one\u2019s development. I was worried at that time, the whole year, because I just did not know how to realse my stress, like now, I can go fitness, programming, everything is so interesting for me. But at that time, once I got stressed, play games, play phone games, stop, do problem sets, getting stressed again, continuing playing games. This is a endless loop, and I could not jump it, because I never tried another way to get relaxed. I once told my father I wanted to lose weight just after the high school entrence exam, but he refused me, I did not know the reason, I was ashamed before my friend, and I locked the door, from 3pm to 8 pm at night, and got sleep at 10pm, \r\nI did not remember what happened exactly, but I knew I cried a lot, stop crying, think about these three years, cried again. And the second day, seemed nothing happened, but leaves a wide gap between I and my father. But actually, did I was a person with weak willpower? No, never, I could spend three months to keep running on the running machine for long time everyday during the vacation after gaokao, and also could study for 15,16 hours studying at the university. But why I abondoned myself at that time? Because I do not have such oppotunities, I was not allowed to do this to do that, just keep the rules, being a \u201cquiet stutent\u201d, listening the commonds from teachers and parents. What\u2019s the meaning of the learning? Someone told me to get a good university. But what\u2019s up if I am not graduated from a good university? You\u2019re stupid, this society will not accept you, your could not enter the good company. And I asked again, but I don\u2019t want to enter the good company, being a normal person is also decent, isn\u2019t it? He replied me with repeating my words, and I knew nothing to talk with him. So I dis not figure out the relationship between career and diploma, the society, I lived in a different world, an artifical one, created by adults, and confused. Even now, I do not think getting a good university\u2019s diploma is critical important, that\u2019s not equal I do not want to go top university, the fame, the reputation, are always the non-significant factors, but the most important is you can find good people, good professors, good students who have the same dream as yours. I made some friends during these two semesters, and I though they are totally different from my friends who I ever made, they talked about their plans, their ideas, so gradually I learned from they, told what I though and my plans to them, and I felt that\u2019s the different feeling from former. Because I used to make friends and did not talk what I real thought, and they also did. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a time to give an end. Sometimes my father gives me a hug, and in fact, I refused this hug either by refusing it with a relucant expression or receving it but refusing it in my heart. I know this hug has some addtional condition, becasuse this hug means owning, you are my kid, I would posses you as my wealth. And gradually, I learned I am becoming that person that people alway say\u201d adopting the son in order to support yourself when you\u2019re older\u201d. Even if you will go abroad in the future, and even lead a good time, ten times good than what you will be in domestic when you\u2019re trying your best. I disagree his point not because I do not want to take the responsibility to take care of him when he gets older, but I am aganish why he askes me fulfill my responsibility in this way which must ruin my dream ruining my efforts. If you say Chinese people are always treasuring native land and setting in stability, sorry, I am an American. I do not want to be the slave of parents, I do not want to be ont part of this restricted tradition. I think highly of my eudcation, my development, I will own my career in the future, nobody would stop me.

Think before programming, gaining happiness from the code if your result is equal to your expectation.\ud83d\ude0e", "date": "2017-09-09", "description": "Re-recognize java, small thinking of

The time difference makes me tired off, wanting to vomit anything driven by my unrecovered never system. The people here, you can't talk freely because of your broken English. Gradually, the mind \"why I leave Chian confused me\" abrupted up, but I never want to back again. Here is my future, of fortune and opportunity, I know this. There's no absolute way, just flowering in another branch you choose. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"photoset-grid-lightbox\" data-layout=\"2\" style=\"visibility:hidden\">\r\n            <img src=\"https://panbloresbed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/a_week_in_usa/grass.JPG\" alt=\"\">\r\n            <img src=\"https://panbloresbed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/a_week_in_usa/sky.JPG\" alt=\"\">\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\nI am better! I mean the independence, the American students are not independent as imagined before, most of them still need preparing by their parents, families accompanying them around, trunk packed with love, inescapable love from parents, they are surrounded with love, the comfortable love, they never think to leave away. You can see everyone, enthusiastic, but u never know how they think in which way, that is horrible.\r\n\r\nA week in America, a meaningful day, I can't cherish this day with my friends enjoying at a fancy eatery but celebrating myself with hilarity. Loneliness is my only friend, which keeps me calm, reminds me what am I eager to tightly, distinguishes me in this unknown country. Sharping your intelligence, embracing the challenges you'll meet, greet everyone with your unique warmness.
