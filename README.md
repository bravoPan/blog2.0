# blog2.0
a new designed blog (5 years ago), the goal of this project was to practice my django web application dev skill at the time, it contains 20+ blogs of my university life at XJTLU. Now it is archieved to keep on the github as my backup project and historical artifact.

Until now, something I've achieved:

- technical: I learned how to manage python project:
  - in differnt python verions by Dockerfile.
  - in different packages by virtualenv.
  - automate everything in bash/Jenkins/Ansible.
- non-technial: 
  - I'll graduate from an ivy leauage uni with my master's degree.
  - I'll work in a tech company in bay area as my first full time job.
  - I'll be more ambious to become an expert in my field.
  
There was a few blog posts I got lost from my MBP15@2015 system reinstallment. Also I won't use this blog to write article, the main portal I'll be is on my [mirror](https://mirror.xyz/0x6419d00a7d2d3cBF54987edCa0B535625E23b6dE). So goodbye my blog app!
